## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to focus on responsive web design in order to ensure visibility across a variety of devices and windows/screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp Article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-page-width-height/) - This is a very helpful article that discusses how to set width and height for full page size. I often times would have issues with making pages full-sized and the result would include a verticle scroll bar. I was able to eliminate the vertical scroll bar but still maintain a full-sized web page.
